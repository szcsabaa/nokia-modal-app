# Nokia Frontend homework solution

This repository contains my solution for the assigned homework. To get started, install the required dependencies using `npm install`, and launch the application with `npm run dev`.

The project includes two example pages demonstrating the modal functionality:

- Multiple Modal Opening: Opens three modals programmatically stacked on top of each other.
- Form Modal: Displays a modal containing an embedded registration form.


Tests are included and can be executed with `npm run test`. However, the test coverage is partial, as full coverage was not specified in the project requirements.

## Used libraries in the project

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tanstack-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) 
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Missing Features and Potential Improvements

- Animations for opening and closing the modal-
- Extend the test cases to cover the entire application.
- More complex integration and end-to-end testing
- A more opinionated and flexible styling system that offers predefined options
- Proper documentation
